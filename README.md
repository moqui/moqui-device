# Moqui Device

[![license](http://img.shields.io/badge/license-CC0%201.0%20Universal-blue.svg)](https://github.com/moqui/moqui-device/blob/master/LICENSE.md)

Moqui Device is a Moqui Framework component that provides a **complete, universal
data model for industrial device nodes and digital twins** — physical devices,
logical devices, device groups, subsystems, production cells, lines, and plant
nodes — as the dual of [moqui-math](https://github.com/moqui/moqui-math).
It models devices as digital twins, defines how to communicate with them
(fieldbus protocols, message brokers, REST gateways), and governs their behaviour
over time through a rule and configuration engine.

A math model cannot run without a device; a device cannot be meaningfully
described without modelling what it computes. `moqui-device` is the device half
of that pairing — the single, auditable source of truth for what a device *is*,
what it *runs*, and what it *did*.

## Trajectories and discrete-event systems

A device's behaviour over time can be described in two fundamental forms, and
the model covers both. A **trajectory** is a continuous path through a state
space; its states are transitory and constantly evolving, as with a robot arm
moving through space or a thermodynamic process following a temperature
profile. A **discrete-event system (DES)** instead evolves through a sequence of
state transitions fired by events or transition conditions. Its states are
stable and discrete: the system dwells in a state until the required condition
or event allows it to leave that state and enter the next one, as with a batch
advancing through its phases or an industrial bioprocess stepping between
operating states.

The distinction concerns state evolution, not an exclusive classification of
the physical device. Industrial systems are often hybrid: a DES orchestrates
stable operating modes while one or more trajectories describe the continuous
motion or process evolution performed inside a mode. The model therefore allows
StatusFlow-based discrete orchestration and mathematical trajectories to be
used together while preserving their different semantics.

The math/device duality captures the continuous case directly:
`moqui.math.Trajectory` describes the path, and `TrajectoryAxisBinding` maps its
axes (position, velocity, acceleration, jerk, snap) onto the concrete parameters
of the device that executes it — a servo axis or a temperature ramp alike. The
discrete case is captured by the device status flows (below), where state and
transition are the modelling primitives. The same component therefore lets you
model, command, log, and audit both how a device *moves* and how it *switches*.

### Device-level and parameter-level logs

`DeviceLog` and `ParameterLog` represent different scopes, independently from
whether a payload is numeric, textual, or enumerated. In the `moqui-plc`
`LogEvent` transport contract, `loggerName` is the exact owning
`Device.deviceId`. An empty `source` denotes a device-level event stored in
`DeviceLog`; a non-empty `source` is the exact, pre-existing
`Parameter.parameterId` and is stored in `ParameterLog`. Descriptive
`deviceName` and `parameterName` values are not persistent keys, and the gateway
must neither concatenate logger fields nor create missing Parameters from an
inbound log.

### Device status flows, and why automation reduces to FSMs

Two built-in status flows are provided as seed data:

- **DeviceBasicStatusFlow** — `Disabled → Standstill → Homing / Run / SynchronizedRun → Stopping → ErrorStop`
- **DeviceAdvancedStatusFlow** — adds `OperationInhibited` and `EmergencyStop`

Both follow the IEC 61131-3 / PLCopen Motion Control state-machine conventions.
These status flows are not only documentation: combined with the device model
they are the source from which [moqui-plc](https://github.com/moqui/moqui-plc)
generates the FSM logic that runs on the controller, defined data-driven through
the `StatusType`, `StatusItem`, `StatusFlow`, `StatusFlowItem`, and
`StatusFlowTransition` entities of moqui-framework's `BasicEntities.xml`.

The architectural reason this works is worth stating, because it is the central
design choice of the whole stack. The reusable components — `Actuator`,
`ActuatorGroup`, `Axis`, `AxisGroup`, `SignalMgmt` — form a **Hardware
Abstraction Layer**. Once the messy device-level detail (handshakes, motion
function blocks, signal conditioning) is hidden behind that HAL, the *behaviour*
of a machine or process can be expressed as a **finite state machine**: a small
set of states, a set of input and output symbols, and the transition and output
functions between them.

This is not a loose analogy. An FSM is a precise mathematical object — the
ordered quintuple (input alphabet, output alphabet, set of states, next-state
function, output function) familiar from logic-network and automata theory.
Expressing automation problems in this form gives them a **solid mathematical
basis**: the model is finite, enumerable, and analysable. Bringing this
hardware-design discipline — the methods of synchronous logic networks — into the
software layer is what makes the approach valuable beyond convenience. Because the
state space and transitions are explicit and finite, the generated code can be
**tested and validated as a mathematical object**: every state reachable, every
transition exercised, every output checked against the specification. The model
that defines the FSM is the same model against which its test suite is built.

The two flows above are the built-in starting points; real machines extend and
compose them, and the HAL keeps even complex coordinated systems expressible as
FSMs over abstracted components rather than as ad hoc procedural code.

### Device type taxonomy

`DeviceData.xml` contains an extensive taxonomy of device types aligned with
MTConnect, ISO 9787, and ISO 8373: controllers (PLC, PAC, CNC, motion, robot),
drives, sensors, actuators, RFID, network devices, IoT gateways, computing
servers (GPU, HPC, twin servers), and device group types for clusters,
manufacturing cells, HVAC, and conveyor systems.

## Recipes, batch management, and system engineering

Industrial configuration is not just a list of editable values. In a real plant,
some information is part of the machine model and must be authored only by
trusted seed data, engineers, administrators, or AI-assisted technical tools:
physical devices, device groups, group membership, parameter definitions, register
metadata, serial numbers, UUIDs, hashes, hardware mappings, and safety limits.

The operator-facing layer is different. Operators and production engineers work
with recipes, cycles, phases, checks, and parameter values. `moqui-device`
therefore separates the **technical definition** of a machine from the
**operational rule set** that applies recipes to that machine.

The key entities are:

| Entity | Plain meaning | Typical industrial analogy |
|---|---|---|
| `ParameterDef` | Definition of one parameter: name, type, unit, bounds, meaning, register semantics | One field in a PLC recipe definition or drive parameter/register list |
| `DeviceConfig` + `Parameter` | Reusable atomic recipe/configuration/macro | One Codesys recipe, one ABB drive macro, one tuning profile, one startup/safety baseline |
| `DeviceRule` | One operation that applies, checks, asserts, suggests, or validates one `DeviceConfig` against one target device | Load one recipe into one device; compare expected values; detect drift |
| `DeviceRuleSet` | Ordered production/batch/system-engineering plan anchored to one root `Device` | Production cycle, batch procedure, commissioning sequence, startup plan, validation procedure |
| `Device` + `Parameter` | Live/materialized values on one device or system node | PLC global variables after recipe load; actual drive parameters after tuning |
| `PhysicalDevice` | Hardware identity attached to a `Device` | Real drive, PLC, instrument, gateway, serial-numbered machine |
| `DeviceGroup` + `DeviceGroupMember` | System-engineering grouping of devices | HVAC subsystem, compressor rack, cell, line, plant area |

Multi-step and multi-device composition is modeled through `DeviceRuleSet` and `DeviceRule.priority`.

### `DeviceConfig` is the atomic recipe; `Device + Parameter` is the live state

A `DeviceConfig` is a reusable configuration artifact. It may contain parameter
values through `Parameter.deviceConfigId`, and it may also refer to a control
method or a trajectory. It is therefore more general than a scalar PLC recipe: it
can describe values to load, the control method to use, and the trajectory or
profile to execute.

A `Device` has its own `Parameter` rows through `Parameter.deviceId`. Those rows
represent the values that are actually present, loaded, measured, materialized,
or maintained for that specific device or system node. A device may initially
receive its values from a `DeviceConfig`, but the two are not the same thing.
After the load operation, device values may diverge because of manual HMI changes,
service tuning, emergency intervention, automatic adaptation, or maintenance.

For example, an ABB ACH580 drive macro may declare:

```text
DeviceConfig: ACH580_COMPRESSOR_MACRO_V1
  maxSpeed = 50 Hz
  accelTime = 30 s
  decelTime = 30 s
```

When this macro is loaded into `COMP_17_DRIVE`, the drive receives live values:

```text
Device: COMP_17_DRIVE
  maxSpeed = 50 Hz
  accelTime = 30 s
  decelTime = 30 s
```

Later a technician may reduce the maximum speed directly on the drive or HMI:

```text
Device: COMP_17_DRIVE
  maxSpeed = 45 Hz
```

The original `DeviceConfig` still says `50 Hz`; the live `Device` state now says
`45 Hz`. This difference is intentional and useful: a later `DeviceRule` can
check compliance, report drift, or suggest restoring the expected value.

### `PhysicalDevice` contains hardware identity

`Device` is the operational digital-twin node. It may represent a physical device,
a logical device, a device group, a subsystem, a cell, a line, or a plant node.
For this reason hardware identity fields do not belong to `Device`.

Serial number, UUID, hardware hash, firmware version, vendor, model and similar
nameplate data belong to `PhysicalDevice`, because they identify the real
hardware asset. A `DeviceGroup` does not have one physical serial number; it has
members that may each have their own `PhysicalDevice` identity.

### `DeviceRuleSet.deviceId` defines the root scope

`DeviceRuleSet` is the main composition mechanism for batch management and system
engineering. It replaces the need for a separate static configuration-set layer.

Every `DeviceRuleSet` is anchored to one root `Device` through
`DeviceRuleSet.deviceId`:

```text
DeviceRuleSet: COMP01_DRIVE_PRODUCTION_CYCLE
  root deviceId = COMP01_ACH580_DRIVE
```

or:

```text
DeviceRuleSet: CELL01_HVAC_PRODUCTION_CYCLE
  root deviceId = CELL01_HVAC_GROUP
```

The root controls what the rules inside the set are allowed to target.

If the root is a physical/logical device, every `DeviceRule.deviceId` in the set
must target that same device:

```text
DeviceRuleSet: COMP01_DRIVE_PRODUCTION_CYCLE
  root deviceId = COMP01_ACH580_DRIVE

priority 10:
  target deviceId = COMP01_ACH580_DRIVE
  apply          = ACH580_SAFE_LIMITS

priority 20:
  target deviceId = COMP01_ACH580_DRIVE
  apply          = ACH580_STARTUP

priority 30:
  target deviceId = COMP01_ACH580_DRIVE
  apply          = ACH580_RUN
```

If the root is a device group or system node, each `DeviceRule.deviceId` must
target the root itself or a member device within that group, including nested
members where recursive group expansion is implemented:

```text
DeviceRuleSet: CELL01_HVAC_PRODUCTION_CYCLE
  root deviceId = CELL01_HVAC_GROUP

priority 10:
  target deviceId = COMPRESSOR_DRIVE_01
  apply          = COMPRESSOR_SAFE_LIMITS

priority 10:
  target deviceId = CONDENSER_FAN_01
  apply          = CONDENSER_SAFE_LIMITS

priority 10:
  target deviceId = AHU_FAN_01
  apply          = AHU_SAFE_LIMITS

priority 20:
  target deviceId = COMPRESSOR_DRIVE_01
  apply          = COMPRESSOR_STARTUP

priority 20:
  target deviceId = AHU_FAN_01
  apply          = AHU_STARTUP

priority 30:
  target deviceId = COMPRESSOR_DRIVE_01
  apply          = COMPRESSOR_RUN

priority 30:
  target deviceId = AHU_FAN_01
  apply          = AHU_RUN
```

This prevents a cycle for one machine, cell or plant area from accidentally
operating on devices outside its root scope.

### `DeviceRule.priority` is the system-engineering phase

A `DeviceRule` always operates on one `DeviceConfig`. Multiple rules inside a
`DeviceRuleSet` compose a production cycle, commissioning sequence, validation
procedure, or recovery procedure.

Rules with the same priority belong to the same logical phase. Increasing
priority values represent progression through commissioning, startup, production
phases, batch phases, subsystem configuration, validation, compliance checking,
recovery, or shutdown.

```text
priority 10 = safety baseline
priority 20 = startup
priority 30 = production run
priority 40 = compliance check
```

This is the central batch-management distinction:

```text
DeviceConfig
  = one reusable atomic recipe/macro/profile

DeviceRule
  = one operation applying/checking that recipe against one target

DeviceRuleSet
  = ordered plan that composes many operations under one root device/group
```

The model therefore keeps recipe logic separate from equipment control while
still making the execution plan explicit, scoped, auditable and suitable for
system engineering.


## Math–Device duality

`moqui.device` and `moqui.math` are two complementary faces of one problem. The
binding entity `DeviceMathModel` connects them so the *same* governance machinery
— config history, rule evaluation, audit log, effective dating — serves a PLC
moving a servo and a GPU cluster training a transformer, unchanged. The only knob
that differs is the device type. This is the part general MLOps tooling lacks:
those tools come from the software side and treat the device as a deployment
detail; here it is co-primary.

## Services

| Service | Description |
|---|---|
| `moqui.device.DeviceServices.run#DeviceRequest` | Dispatches a single `DeviceRequest` to its configured implementation service |
| `moqui.device.DeviceServices.run#DeviceRequestGroup` | Runs all requests in a named group; designed to be called as a scheduled service |
| `moqui.device.DeviceServices.run#DeviceRequestInternal` | Interface that driver components (e.g. `moqui-plc4j`) must implement |
| `moqui.device.DeviceServices.send#DeviceNotification` | Sends a Moqui notification for a device event |
| `moqui.device.DeviceGatewayServices.run#GatewayDeviceRequest` | Dispatches scalar parameter write/read/subscribe requests via the `moqui-device-gateway` REST API (MQTT / OPC UA) |
| `moqui.device.DeviceGatewayServices.export#DeviceConfig` | Exports a device configuration recipe (Codesys txt format, persistent data) via the gateway |
| `moqui.device.DeviceGatewayServices.export#Trajectory` | Exports a computed trajectory as a structured JSON payload to the gateway for MQTT publishing (ephemeral bulk data) |
| `moqui.device.DeviceGatewayServices.transfer#DeviceContent` | Streams a file (G-Code, firmware, recipe) to a device via the gateway SFTP/file endpoint |

### Device content transfer destination

`moqui.device.DeviceGatewayServices.transfer#DeviceContent` reads the source
file from `DeviceContent.contentLocation`, but that is **not** the final
destination path on the target side.

The effective destination is the **gateway-side** `DeviceRequest.brokerUri`
resolved by the `requestName` passed to the service.

In practical terms:

- Moqui reads the source file from `DeviceContent.contentLocation`
- Moqui sends the file bytes to `moqui-device-gateway`
- the gateway loads the gateway-side `DeviceRequest`
- the gateway writes the file to the URI stored in `DeviceRequest.brokerUri`

Typical destination examples are:

- `file:/mnt/cnc-share/programs`
- `file:/var/lib/plc/recipes`
- `sftp:operator@cnc1.factory.local:22/programs`

So, when an operator uses **Transfer Content**, the file is transferred to the
path or endpoint declared in the gateway-side `DeviceRequest.brokerUri`.

### Transfer content seed data in `DeviceTestData.xml`

The industrial test suite ships two Moqui-side requests and two gateway-side
requests so the **Transfer Content** button can be tested end to end.

Moqui-side requests:

- `VIRTUAL_PLC_01_TransferContent`
- `DG_EDGE_01_TransferContent`

These are the request names referenced by the SimpleScreens transitions. They
call `moqui.device.DeviceGatewayServices.transfer#DeviceContent` and point to
the gateway HTTP endpoint through `brokerUri`, for example:

- `http://localhost:8081?apiKey=change-me-in-production`

Their `query` field identifies the gateway-side request that performs the final
write:

- `VIRTUAL_PLC_01_GatewayTransferContent`
- `DG_EDGE_01_GatewayTransferContent`

Gateway-side requests:

- `VIRTUAL_PLC_01_GatewayTransferContent`
- `DG_EDGE_01_GatewayTransferContent`

These are standard `DrtContentTransfer` requests executed locally by
`moqui-device-gateway`. Their `brokerUri` is the real destination path, for
example:

- `file:target/transferred-content/plc`
- `file:target/transferred-content/device-group`

So the transfer chain is:

1. operator clicks **Transfer Content** in Moqui
2. Moqui resolves the Moqui-side `*_TransferContent` request
3. Moqui posts the file bytes to `moqui-device-gateway`
4. the gateway resolves the matching `*_GatewayTransferContent` request
5. the gateway writes the file to the `brokerUri` target directory

## Service layer — Python ecosystem via moqui-jep

`moqui.device` follows the same philosophy as `moqui.math`: it defines entities,
seed data, and the service interfaces only. Driver implementations that
communicate with physical devices over fieldbus protocols (Modbus, OPC UA,
EtherNet/IP, CANopen, etc.) are provided by separate components such as
**moqui-plc4j** (Apache PLC4X, JVM) or Python libraries (python-opcua, pymodbus,
python-snap7, etc.) embedded via **moqui-jep**. Control algorithms and ML
inference services likewise run through moqui-jep using NumPy, SciPy, JAX, or
python-control.

## Example service: 6-DOF robot arm trajectory planning

`moqui-device` ships an end-to-end example that shows how math modelling,
ML inference, and device binding work together. The service
`moqui.device.TrajectoryPlannerServices.run#RobotArmTrajectoryPlanner`
computes a collision-free joint-space trajectory for a 6-DOF robot arm using a
small feedforward neural network and persists the full output chain into the
moqui-math entity model.

### Neural network

A three-layer MLP (12 → 128 → 256 → 60) is trained offline on 50 000 synthetic
quintic-spline trajectories with the script
`script/train_robot_arm_trajectory_planner.py`. The quintic (degree-5) basis
enforces zero velocity and acceleration at both endpoints, giving smooth,
jerk-limited motion. Inference runs at runtime via
[DJL](https://djl.ai/) 0.31.0 + ONNX Runtime 1.19.0, which are declared as
Gradle dependencies and placed in `lib/` by the `copyDependencies` task.

Input shape: `float32[1, 12]` — `[q_start(6) ‖ q_goal(6)]` joint angles in
radians. Output shape: `float32[1, 60]` — 10 waypoints × 6 joints, flat
row-major.

### Data modelling

The service writes to the following entity chain on every successful call:

```
MathModelDef ──► MathModel ──► MathModelRun ──► MathModelPerf
                                   │

                          │
                          ▼

```

| Entity | Role |
|---|---|
| `MathModelDef` (`TrjPlannerMlp6Dof`) | Blueprint: model type, service name, version |
| `MathModel` (`TrjPlannerMlp6DofV1`) | Versioned production instance; governed by `MathModelStatusFlow` |
| `MathModelDefContent` | Points to the ONNX file via `component://moqui-device/data/ml/trajectory_planner.onnx` |
| `MathModelRun` | Nontransactional execution record; survives TX rollback; stores input parameters as JSON and output summary |
| `MathModelPerf` | Performance counters: `totalDurationSec` (end-to-end), `inferenceLatencyMs` (DJL `predict()` only), `throughputSamplesSec` |
| `MathModelData` | Three rows per run: output `ApproximatedFunction` + input `Vector` for q_start and q_goal |
| `ApproximatedFunction` | The trajectory container; `vectorSpaceEnumId = EngJointSpace6Dof` (6-DOF revolute joint space) |
| `ParametricPath` | Path-level metadata; `profileEnumId = PppfTrajectoryProfile` |
| `Trajectory` | Time-tagged motion; `controlMethodEnumId = PtcmNNControl` |
| `ApproximatedFunctionSample` (×10) | One per waypoint (WP0000–WP0009); start, waypoint, end type |
| `ParametricPathPoint` (×10) | Path geometry for each sample |
| `TrajectoryPoint` (×10) | Absolute time offset in milliseconds (uniform 1 s total) |
| `Vector` + `VectorComponent` | Per-waypoint 6-DOF joint angle vector; plus separate vectors for q_start and q_goal |

### Model lifecycle tracking

The `MathModel` lifecycle is governed by `MathModelStatusFlow`
(`Draft → Validation → Production → Archived`). Every inference call creates a
`MathModelRun` record (nontransactional, `use="nontransactional"`) that captures:

- `startTime` / `endDate` — wall-clock span
- `parameters` — JSON snapshot of `startConfig` and `goalConfig`
- `results` — JSON summary (`approximatedFunctionId`, `waypointCount`)
- `hasError` / `errors` — fault isolation without rolling back the parent transaction
- `approximatedFunctionId` — direct FK to the output trajectory

`MathModelPerf` records two timing levels: `totalDurationSec` covers the full
service call including entity persistence; `inferenceLatencyMs` covers only the
DJL `predictor.predict()` call, which is the figure relevant to real-time control
cycle budgets.

The `MathModelData` snowflake table links the run to all mathematical objects it
produced or consumed, enabling complete data lineage: given a `MathModelRun` it
is possible to reconstruct exactly which model version, which inputs, and which
output trajectory were involved.

### Extending to real servo drives with TrajectoryAxisBinding

The `moqui.math.Trajectory` computed above is a **mathematical object** — a
sequence of 6-DOF joint-angle waypoints. To **execute** it on a physical robot
arm the waypoints must be mapped to the parameters of real servo drives or a
motion controller. That bridge is `TrajectoryAxisBinding`:

```
ApproximatedFunction ──► TrajectoryAxisBinding
                              │   (per axis / per device)
                              ├── approximatedFunctionId  (FK → Trajectory)
                              ├── axisName                (e.g. "J1" … "J6")
                              ├── deviceId                (FK → Device / servo drive)
                              ├── pointParameterDefId     (position setpoint parameter)
                              ├── velocityParameterDefId  (velocity feed-forward)
                              ├── accelerationParameterDefId
                              ├── jerkParameterDefId
                              └── snapParameterDefId
```

Each row binds one axis of the mathematical trajectory to one device parameter
definition. Once the binding is in place it becomes possible to:

- **Validate kinematic limits before execution**: retrieve the `ParameterDef`
  records identified by `pointParameterDefId` / `velocityParameterDefId` /
  `accelerationParameterDefId` and compare each `VectorComponent` value against
  the drive's configured min/max bounds. Any waypoint that violates a limit can be
  flagged before a single motion command is issued.
- **Dispatch the trajectory to the drive**: call `export#Trajectory` (ephemeral
  bulk path) or `export#DeviceConfig` (persistent recipe path). `export#Trajectory`
  reads the `ApproximatedFunctionSample` / `VectorComponent` chain directly and
  publishes a structured per-axis JSON payload via `moqui-device-gateway` → MQTT →
  `MqttParameterSub` on the controller. `export#DeviceConfig` serialises parameters
  as a Codesys txt recipe that the PLC recipe FB loads from the filesystem.
- **Close the feedback loop**: bind the velocity and acceleration derivatives
  (computed from consecutive waypoints and `TrajectoryPoint.pointTimeOffsetMillis`)
  to feed-forward parameters of the drive, reducing tracking error without
  requiring explicit PID tuning changes.

The `TrajectoryAxisBinding` entity uses `use="configuration"` with
`enable-audit-log="true"`, so every change to axis assignments is audited and
effective-dated — essential when certifying motion programs for safety-critical
machinery.

### Dispatching the computed trajectory — export#Trajectory

`TrajectoryPlannerData.xml` ships minimal seed data to test the ephemeral dispatch
path end-to-end:

| Record | Key |
|---|---|
| `Device` | `deviceId = moqui-device-gateway1` |
| `DeviceRequest` | `requestName = ROBOT_ARM_TRAJECTORY_EXPORT` |

The `DeviceRequest` points to a local gateway instance (`brokerUri = http://localhost:8081`)
and carries the MQTT topic in its `query` field (`moqui/robot/arm1/trajectory`).

To dispatch after planning:

```
moqui.device.DeviceGatewayServices.export#Trajectory
    approximatedFunctionId = <output of run#RobotArmTrajectoryPlanner>
    requestName            = ROBOT_ARM_TRAJECTORY_EXPORT
```

The service reads the `ApproximatedFunctionSample` / `VectorComponent` chain directly
(no `DeviceRequestItem` or `Parameter` records required) and POSTs the following
JSON to the gateway endpoint `POST /api/trajectory/export`:

```json
{
  "approximatedFunctionId": "100000",
  "waypointCount": 10,
  "mqttTopic": "moqui/robot/arm1/trajectory",
  "axes": {
    "J1": [0.10, 0.18, …],
    "J2": [0.00, 0.05, …],
    "J3": […], "J4": […], "J5": […], "J6": […]
  }
}
```

The gateway publishes this payload to the MQTT topic; `MqttParameterSub` on the
PLC receives it and passes each key/value pair to `JsonToParametersMapper`, which
maps `"J1"`…`"J6"` array values to the controller's trajectory buffer.

For the **persistent recipe path** use `export#DeviceConfig` instead: store
waypoints as `DeviceConfig/Parameter` entries under a `DeviceRuleSet`, then call
`export#DeviceConfig` to serialise them as a Codesys txt recipe that the PLC
recipe FB loads autonomously from the filesystem.

## Example service: OpenVLA action and visual grounding

`moqui.device.TrajectoryPlannerServices` also exposes two OpenVLA-oriented helper
services designed to bridge Moqui `Device` / `DeviceContent` image records with
external vision-language-action inference endpoints:

- `run#OpenVla`
- `run#OpenVlaGrounding`

Both services resolve an image from `DeviceContent` associated with a `Device`,
encode it as base64 through the Moqui resource system, and delegate the real HTTP
call to a `type="remote-rest"` wrapper service. This keeps the transport contract
declarative while still letting Moqui validate device/image ownership before any
remote inference call is made.

### `run#OpenVla`

`run#OpenVla` targets the `/act` endpoint of an OpenVLA-compatible service. It
returns the predicted continuous action vector together with the model metadata.
This is the direct VLA path for robot control scenarios where the remote service
already knows how to convert the RGB scene and instruction into action-space
values.

### `run#OpenVlaGrounding`

`run#OpenVlaGrounding` targets a `/ground` endpoint and is intended for the
intermediate perception step: identify an object or region in the image and
return reusable geometric data to the Moqui model.

Returned outputs:

- `boundingBox` — `[xMin, yMin, xMax, yMax]` in image pixel coordinates
- `center` — `[x, y]` in image pixel coordinates
- `targetPose` — optional target pose vector produced by the remote service
- `goalPose` — alias of `targetPose`, ready to pass to `run#RobotArmTrajectoryPlanner`
- `objectLabel`, `confidence`, `coordinateSystem`, `modelId`

When `saveResult = true`, the service also persists the result into
`moqui.math.Vector` / `VectorComponent` so the grounding output can be reused in
later steps or audited independently from the original inference response:

- `boundingBoxMinVectorId`
- `boundingBoxMaxVectorId`
- `centerVectorId`
- `targetPoseVectorId`

This means the same grounding result can be:

- consumed immediately in-memory by a caller
- stored in the mathematical model for later reuse
- forwarded as `goalPose` into `run#RobotArmTrajectoryPlanner`
- or all three at once

### Production note

The intended production setup is GPU-backed OpenVLA / OWLv2 inference deployed
through `moqui-deploy/industrial/openvla`. A CPU-only fallback was validated for
the `/ground` path using a lighter OWLViT grounding model, but the main
`openvla/openvla-7b` action model remains a GPU-oriented deployment target.

## Unified test data

`data/DeviceTestData.xml` is the canonical Moqui-side test suite for the component.
It is intentionally small but complete enough to exercise the main industrial
flows together:

- one control-cell `DeviceGroup`;
- one generic PLC, one drive, and one gateway as physical devices;
- atomic `DeviceConfig` records for factory defaults and production profiles;
- `DeviceRuleSet` and `DeviceRule` rows for process/task application;
- device-scoped `Parameter` values and config-scoped `Parameter` values;
- observability records for `ParameterLog`, `DeviceLog`, and `Measurement`;
- Grafana-ready `DeviceDashboard` assignments used by the SimpleScreens UI.

This XML seed is the reference scenario mirrored by the local SQL fixtures in
`moqui-device-gateway`. The SQL files may stay transport-oriented for Camel
tests, but the IDs, device roles, and operational meaning should remain aligned
with `DeviceTestData.xml`.

`data/HVACDemoData.xml` is the process-automation example reverse-engineered
from the `mantle-hvac` CODESYS application in `moqui-plc`. It contains the flat
HVAC status flow, Application/CPU, subsystem and atomic-device tree, the Civil
Cooling/Heating/Dehumidifying recipes composed through `DeviceRuleSet`, and the
approved MQTT live-parameter whitelist. Recipe values exclude runtime `actual`
durations and process feedback; those remain device-bound parameters. Device
and parameter names are logical Moqui names without the CODESYS `dev.` prefix;
the gateway/PLC projection adds that namespace only when emitting IEC paths.

### HVAC seed-first example

The HVAC file is also a worked example of how to create the declaration layer
for a real PLC Application. Its records are derived in the following order:

1. model the CODESYS Application/CPU as one `Device`/`PhysicalDevice`;
2. decompose the application into developer-approved subsystem `DeviceGroup`
   records and atomic devices such as pumps, valves, fans and dampers;
3. create reusable `ParameterDef` records, then bind logical values and runtime
   feedback to their owning devices with `Parameter`;
4. represent the UI-visible FSM with `StatusFlow`, `StatusFlowItem` and
   `StatusFlowTransition`, while keeping predicates, interlocks, state output
   functions and deterministic invocation order in PLC code;
5. declare atomic `DeviceConfig` recipes and compose them for each process mode
   through ordered `DeviceRuleSet`/`DeviceRule` rows;
6. whitelist only the reviewed, device-bound parameters that may receive live
   updates through `DeviceRequestItem`.

After `moqui-math` and `moqui-device` are installed under
`runtime/component`, load the example with the normal Moqui seed-data flow:

```shell
./gradlew load -Ptypes=seed
```

The same reviewed seed then drives three downstream projections:

| Seed model | PLC/code-generation use | Gateway use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Device`, `PhysicalDevice`, groups and parameters | Generate and cross-check the `DeviceFacade`, atomic FB catalog and diagnostics scaffolding | Resolve controller, device and parameter identity without embedding IEC names in Moqui |
| `StatusFlow` topology | Generate status declarations and transition topology; complete code-owned predicates and state actions through the reviewed agent workflow | Expose the machine state model to Moqui screens and other consumers |
| `DeviceConfig`, `DeviceRuleSet`, `DeviceRule` | Define the complete configurable recipe surface, excluding actual/feedback values | `export#DeviceConfig` emits deterministic CODESYS txtrecipe assignments such as `dev.tempSetpoint` and `dev.coldGlycolPump.enableTime` |
| device-bound feedback parameters plus transport requests | Generate typed PLC/gateway mappings after protocol and physical binding are reviewed | Subscribe or poll acquisition values over MQTT v5 or OPC UA and update the corresponding Moqui parameters |
| approved live-update `DeviceRequestItem` rows | Generate the Application-specific `JsonToParametersMapper` used by `MqttParameterSub` | Publish only the whitelisted setpoints and timing parameters to the configured MQTT topic |

`HVACDemoData.xml` currently provides the authoritative device/feedback catalog,
the recipe-export request and the approved live-update request. Acquisition
`DeviceRequest` rows are application- and transport-specific: the agent creates
them from the reviewed signal catalog, sampling domains, MQTT topics or OPC UA
node IDs instead of inventing physical bindings in this generic example.

This separation is intentional. The seed remains authoritative for persistent
identity, configuration, request metadata and StatusFlow topology; generated
PLC code remains authoritative for process semantics, interlocks and the exact
execution order. The gateway executes the reviewed transport projection without
becoming a second configuration source.
